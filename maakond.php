        <p class="lead">Aries is the first sign of the zodiac, and that's pretty much how those born under
            this sign see themselves: first. Aries are the leaders of the pack, first in line to get things going.
            Whether or not everything gets done is another question altogether, for an Aries prefers to initiate
            rather than to complete. Do you have a project needing a kick-start? Call an Aries, by all means.
            The leadership displayed by Aries is most impressive, so don't be surprised if they can rally the
            troops against seemingly insurmountable odds.</p>
